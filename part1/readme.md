# Snake Game with AI Learning

This is a **Snake game** implemented in Python, where the snake can learn to play automatically using a **Genetic Algorithm**. The project uses `pygame` for the game interface, `numpy` for mathematical operations, and `matplotlib` to visualize the training progress.

## Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics.
- AI-controlled snake that learns to survive and collect food.
- Learning is done via a **Genetic Algorithm**:
  - Each snake is represented as an individual.
  - Snakes are evaluated based on their performance (fitness).
  - The best-performing snakes are selected to breed the next generation.
  - Mutation is applied to introduce variation.
- Visualization of snake population fitness over generations using `matplotlib`.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
# snake_game_with_neural_network_and_genetic_algorithm
